### Real G-Con2 & G-Con45 Emulation for PLaystation 1 and 2 Lightgun Gaming using a Sinden Lightgun

SindenPS is a custom hardware–software bridge that lets modern Sinden Lightguns behave like authentic PlayStation 1 or 2 lightguns — including full G-Con2 and G-Con45 emulation, real‑time input translation, and automatic mode switching.  
If you’ve ever wanted your Sinden to *just work* with PlayStation 1 or 2 lightgun games on real hardware, this project makes it happen.

## 🎯 What SindenPS Does

SindenPS turns a pair of Arduinos into fully‑fledged USB lightgun devices that the PlayStation 1 or 2 ecosystem recognises as the real thing.

### GunCon2 Mode (Arduino Pro Micro)
- Emulates official GunCon2 USB descriptors  
- Translates Sinden Lightgun HID reports into GunCon2 input packets  
- Supports trigger, buttons, D‑pad, and screen‑positioning  

### GCon45 Mode (Arduino Nano)
- Emulates the original G-Con45 protocol for PS1/early PS2 titles  
- Lightweight, low‑latency serial translation  
- Ideal for games expecting the older Namco protocol  

### Automatic Mode Switching
SindenPS detects which Arduino is connected and switches the Lightgun Emulation mode accordingly — no manual toggling or scripts.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

```
[Sinden Lightgun] → [Raspberry Pi running SindenPS] → 	[Arduino Pro Micro] → G-Con2 USB Device
														↓
														[Arduino Nano] → G-Con45 Device
```

- **Sinden Lightgun Driver**: Listens to Sinden HID reports and forwards them to the correct Arduino.  
- **Arduinos**: Each exposes the correct USB/Conroller interface and handles real‑time input translation.  
- **Dashboard**: A clean UI for switching profiles, managing services, and monitoring input.
